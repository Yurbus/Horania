                                <p>The Hurania movement is an idea for an intentional community located in Hungary, made up of diaspora Hungarians 
                                    and similarly minded European expatriates that is inspired and modeled on the successful community of Orania 
                                    in South Africa.

                                <p>
                                    In the year 2000, I recognized the instability of the United States.  I observed a deeply divided country, 
                                    led by two corrupt political parties, as it utterly failed to assemble any sort of coherent vision that 
                                    would serve the people.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    After coming to this realization, I spent a number of years looking into the sources of deterioration and any actions 
                                    that might be taken to ameliorate the situation in the United States.  As time went on, I became more and more convinced 
                                    that the U.S. was headed for serious problems in the future, and that there was very little (if anything) that an individual 
                                    person or family could do to change this.  Nothing has happened since then to alter the conclusion that I reached 24 years ago.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </section> 
                <section class="content__block">
                    <div class="content__container">
                        <div class="content__body">
                            <div class="content__text">
                                <p>
                                    Over the years, I learned about the life-cycle of civilizations, and this was both a 
                                    source of comfort (that I understood what was happening) and agitation (that I needed 
                                    to do something in response to it). 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It seemed, at this stage of our civilization, that the best thing one could hope to do was 
                                    to "carry the fire" until the next "rebirth."  But what was the best way to do this?  The 
                                    political system was rotten to the core, the economy was deeply dysfunctional and suffered 
                                    from cronyism, the legal system was a mockery and failed to apply the law evenly to all, 
                                    the culture was degenerate and conflicted, and the religious institutions were unprincipled, 
                                    corrupt, and directionless.  The best thing seemed to be to find like-minded people and 
                                    start forming small "intentional communities" in order to distill a new spirit, 
                                    philosophy, and mindset so that we could begin to set the stage to form healthier 
                                    and stronger institutions for the future.

                                <h2 class="content__title">THE AMISH?</h2>
                                <p>
                                    I thought about forming an intentional community in the U.S. The Amish are a successful 
                                    separate group, and they are much to be admired.  Many things can be learned from the 
                                    Amish.  They are a law-abiding group that simply has additional cultural rules that 
                                    must be followed if you wish to remain a member of the group in good standing.  If 
                                    there is a disagreement within the group, they encourage the dissident members to 
                                    simply move away from the parent group and form their own Amish community that more 
                                    accurately reflects the new group's methods and ideas.  Individuals are free to leave 
                                    anytime they wish.  Their families will mourn that they have left, but Amish children 
                                    are plentiful and they have no need to keep anyone in the community against their will 
                                    in order to maintain their unique way of life.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The Amish are also pacifists.  I believe that the U.S. government tolerates them because 
                                    they are not a threat due to this pacifism.  The government knows that they are not a 
                                    threat, and the government is confident that they can be rid of them at any time they 
                                    wish, so they can (largely) leave them alone to stand as an example of their tolerance 
                                    of different views.

                                <p>
                                    Other intentional communities, that may not have Luddite or extreme pacifist ideologies, 
                                    are not tolerated very well.  The U.S. government does not seem to like them and has taken 
                                    violent action against them without much hesitation, remorse, accountability, or justice 
                                    for the victims.  The U.S. government also has a powerful surveillance apparatus and many 
                                    resources to dedicate to infiltrate, entrap, and cause disruption, with the ultimate aim 
                                    of disposing of any movement that constitutes a competing vision for the ordering of 
                                    community or civic life.

                                    So I didn't think that it was a good idea to form an intentional community in the U.S.
                                    Who else had started an intentional community, and did it seem like a good organization 
                                    to join?

                                    As great as it is, there were a few problems that kept Orania from being a solution for me. 
                                    The first is that they may not accept me, as I am not an Afrikaner!  Secondly, while I have 
                                    absolute confidence that they can and will defend themselves, I worry that they will have 
                                    difficulty surviving in a sea of people who do not have favorable opinions of them or their 
                                    way of life.

                                    So I looked at the two difficulties that I had with Orania.  The first is my ethnicity.  
                                    I am half English, 1/4 German and 1/4 Hungarian.  I perceived that England and Germany 
                                    are suffering from the same malaise that exists in the U.S.  But Hungary presented a 
                                    unique and interesting idea.

                                    My mother's grandparents were Hungarian, who immigrated to the U.S. from a part of the 
                                    Austro-Hungarian Empire that today lies within the borders of western Ukraine.  Here 
                                    is a map of the old Austro-Hungarian Empire and all of the ethnic sub-groups that lie 
                                    within its former borders:

                                    The people of Hungary have a very wide European phenotype - from blond hair and blue 
                                    eyes to dark hair and olive complexion and everything in between. Here is a link to their 
                                    DNA haplogroup in comparison to their neighboring European countries:

                                    The people I see everyday remind me of the people I grew up with in the rural U.S. 
                                    in the 1980's.  It is a very comfortable and relatable population, and the people are 
                                    generally very polite and kind.

                                <p>
                                    Like most of Europe, Hungary has a birth rate that is below the replacement rate.  
                                    Unlike most of Europe, they have not elected to remedy this problem by opening their 
                                    borders.  They have instead tried to encourage native Hungarians to have more children, 
                                    and they have promoted birthright citizenship to encourage people of Hungarian descent 
                                    around the world to return home.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I found out about this program and applied for Hungarian citizenship.  It was a lengthy 
                                    process that took about a year, and it was ultimately successful.  I moved my family here 
                                    and I commute back and forth to the U.S. for work every month.  The travel is difficult, 
                                    but I know that my family is safe and healthy.  Ultimately, I plan to build enough of a 
                                    livelihood in Hungary so that I will no longer have to travel back and forth to the U.S.
                                </p>

                                    So my problem is solved, right?  Not exactly - Hungary faces challenges too.  
                                    Also, what good is it to save myself and leave others where I was a few years ago?  
                                    And what about my idea of an intentional community?

                                <p>
                                    This is where both things can work together - I can build an intentional community 
                                    of like-minded people and do it in accord with the Hungarian government's professed 
                                    desire to bring more Hungarians back home.  People can come here and contribute to 
                                    the Hungarian nation, bringing their resources and knowledge, raising their children 
                                    in a safe environment and being a part of something bigger than themselves.

                                    There is a good chance that you have Hungarian heritage if any of your ancestors are from one of these 
                                    countries.  My family thought that we were Ukrainian - until we traveled back to Ukraine and discovered 
                                    that all of our relatives there spoke Hungarian!  They never crossed the border -- the border crossed 
                                    them.  They still live in their ancestral village, but that village now lies in western Ukraine.

                                    We own a small homestead where we raise chickens, grow vegetables, and maintain fruit trees. 
                                    Future expansion is on the agenda.  We have moved to be largely self sufficient with regard 
                                    to electricity, water, and heating.

                                    Right now Hurania is just an idea and a website.  Orania began with two families and built 
                                    a community of 3,000 people in 30 years.  The early adopters of Hurania will set the tone, 
                                    and like other founding fathers, hopefully we will have an idea that will set "brushfires 
                                    of freedom in the minds of men."
